The excel files are the dataset reading by the projects. 
In order to run codes in jupyter notebook file without an error,
the excel files have to be located in same path with the ".ipynb" files. In addition,
there are three diferent ".ipynb" files. While the "Reservoir estimation (Monte Carlo Random).ipynb"
and "Reservoir estimation (Monte Carlo Uniform).ipynb" projects were prepared to find
original oil in place (OOIP) of the reservoir by using statistical method, a computational method was
preferred to use in the "Calculation of Original Oil In Place by Using MBE.ipynb" project.
